%DETECTEDGES A pre-processing function that performs canny edge detection and removes irrelevant background information for the frame provided as input
% INPUT: @edges - Binary image containing only edges in frame that is
%        outputted by detectEdges.m
%        @ransacIterations - Number of iterations run to fit lines to edges
%        in RANSAC 
%        @showPlots - Boolean indicating whether to plot the edges and
%        lines or not
% OUTPUT: @frl - Row information for the line-edge overlap
%         @fcl - Column information for the line-edge overlap
%         @cr - Row information for the fitted line
%         @cc - Column information for the fitted lines
