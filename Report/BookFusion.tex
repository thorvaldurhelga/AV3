\subsection{Book Fusion}

The final task was to apply the transformations described above to each image, giving a final 3D point cloud corresponding to the fused book points. To do this we performed the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Apply the correct rotation matrix to each book point cloud by multiplying the transpose of the book point cloud (in which each (x,y,z) point is represented by a column) by the rotation matrix
	\item Translate each book point cloud by subtracting the co-ordinates of its mean point from the co-ordinates of every point
	\item Combine the individual point clouds to create the overall image
\end{enumerate}
