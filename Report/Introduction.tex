\section{Introduction}
This assignment involved analyzing 21 consecutive image frames captured with a Kinect sensor. These frames contained both RGP pixel intensity values and XYZ range values. The images showed many different angles of a cabinet containing an open book on top. Our goal was the following:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item Extract the three planes that formed the front of the rectangular cabinet and compute their plane equations.
	\item Compute the translation and rotation of the three planes between frames to register all views together.
	\item Extract the set of points belonging to the book.
	\item Register all views of the book together using the translation and rotation computed in step (ii).
\end{enumerate}
At last we wanted to evaluate our approach by ....
