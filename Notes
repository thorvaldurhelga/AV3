1. Extract the 3 large planes of the filing cabinet

Canny edge detection
RANSAC

Output: set of edges of polygons

2. Use the 3 large planes to register the 21 views together

Region growing - doall.m from '3 3D Object Recognition from Range Data'
Pose estimation

or

Edge based - interpretation tree algorithm

Output: Translation and rotation for each image

3. Extract the 3D point set for the points belonging to the book

Output: Set of points belonging to the book in each image (corresponding to corners?)

4. Register the book points using the reference frame transformation estimated from the planes.

Output: Merged book image obtained by averaging over all of the points

5. Evaluation

Output: 21 images showing corner points for the book from head on view
